    <h3>Hello world!</h3>
    <br><img src="snow2.jpg" width="450"><br><br>
    this is my <strong><u>second</u> website</strong>. enjoy it!
    <p>i am wondering that i could change my job as a front end developer.<br>
        It's just full of uncertainty and doubt about my abilty and future.<br>
        I know it could be a horrible idea but i think it's time to trying new thing and this website would be a first
        step of the changing the job.<br>
        Hopefully i can get a job with a nice senior.<br></p>
    <p style="margin-top:45px;"><strong>Good luck!</strong></p>
